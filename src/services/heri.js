            description: "Miniature painting, perfected under the patronage of Mughal emperors like Akbar and Jahangir, is characterized by its meticulous detail, vibrant mineral and vegetable colors, and a strong sense of realism combined with artistic flourish. These small-scale works often capture the grandeur of court life, historical narratives, portraiture, and elaborate scenes from Persian epics or Hindu mythology. The technique requires immense patience and the use of single-hair brushes. The influence of Persian Safavid painting is evident, yet it evolved into a distinctly Indian style, particularly in the use of specific colors and landscape elements. They are priceless historical artifacts, offering a window into the socio-political world of the era.",

Traditionally executed on the walls of homes using a mixture of rice paste (white) on a red ochre background, the paintings are simple, monochromatic, and profoundly symbolic. The human figures are basic geometric shapes: a circle for the head, triangles for the body, and lines for the limbs. The subjects revolve around nature, community life, and agricultural cycles (harvesting, fishing, dancing), reflecting the tribe's deep connection to the earth and their communal spirit. They serve not just as decorations but as visual prayers for a bountiful harvest and well-being.",
